Inspired by the great work of the [#100DaysOfCode challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/), we're starting #100DaysOfOSS. 

With this challenge, OpenSauced hopes to help developers enhance their skills, expand their abilities, and gain practical experience over 100 days, as well as support maintainers, onboard more contributors into open source, and expand the OSS community. With a focus on open source software (OSS), we encourage contributors of all technical backgrounds to immerse themselves in the world of collaborative development and engage with a supportive community.

## How to Participate
The beauty of this challenge is that you're not required to code. The main purpose is to grow in your understanding of open source software (OSS), contribute in ways that are meaningful to you, and further develop the skills and knowledge you're interested in pursuing. It's all about personal growth and making a positive impact on the OSS community.

There are numerous ways to participate in the #100DaysOfOSS challenge, including:

- write issues to identify bugs or suggest new features;
- triage existing issues to help with prioritization;
- submit pull requests to contribute code changes;
- engage in the community by sharing your insights and knowledge;
- create or participate in discussions related to OSS topics;
- write a blog post or create content that supports an OSS project; 
- update or write documentation to improve clarity and usability
- create content: give a talk or presentation on OSS, participate in or even start a Twitter Space write a blog post or create a video;  
- support contributors working on OSS projects, providing guidance and support.

To keep track of your progress, post on social media, your blog, or any other platform you prefer with what progress you made, the day of the challenge indicated by 'D'and include the hashtag #100DaysOfOSS. For example, if you're on day one, you could say, "Today, I reviewed the documentation for the OpenSauced/Insights repository. D1 #100daysOfOSS." Then, on day two, you would continue with D2, and so on.

## The Official Kickoff
We're starting 100 days from the end of Hacktoberfest, a month-long celebration of open source contributions. Join us on this exciting journey, where we'll provide continuous support, daily inspirational tweets, and engaging events to help developers stay motivated and make progress. You can find more details and sign up for the challenge [here](link).

Don't worry if you're unable to start on the same day as everyone else. The #100DaysOfOSS challenge is flexible, and you can join in whenever you're ready. Just jump in at any point and begin with day one of your personal challenge. Each day, make sure to increment your post information to track your progress. For example, on day one, you could say, "Today, I reviewed the documentation for the OpenSauced/Insights repository. R1D1 #100daysOfOSS." Then, on day two, you would continue with R1D2, and so on.

## The Power of the #100DaysOfCode Challenge
The #100DaysOfOSS challenge offers a supportive community where developers can find encouragement, share experiences, and overcome roadblocks together. 

Our hope is that the community will provide a safe space to discuss challenges, celebrate achievements, and exchange insights, creating an environment that helps individuals stay on track and avoid giving up.


## Why join the #100DaysOfOSS Challenge:

1. **Skill Enhancement**: By working on real-world projects, you'll gain practical experience and exposure to different projects, documentation, communities, programming languages, frameworks, and tools. They can also learn from experienced developers, receive feedback on their code, and improve their problem-solving abilities.

2. **Collaboration and Networking**: You'll have the opportunity to work alongside other contributors, collaborate on shared goals, and build professional relationships. This experience can lead to networking opportunities, mentorship, and exposure to diverse perspectives in tech.

3. **Resume and Portfolio Boost**: Experience in open source demonstrates your ability to work in a team, follow best practices, and contribute to larger codebases. Open source contributions are tangible evidence of your skills, commitment, and ability to grow.

4. **Learning from Peers**: By examining the codebase, participating in discussions, engaging in the community, and reviewing pull requests, contributors can gain insights into different approaches to community, projects, coding styles, architecture patterns, and software development best practices, accelerating a developer's learning curve.

5. **Making a Positive Impact**: Your contributions benefit other contributors who rely on these projects, fostering a sense of fulfillment and giving back to the community.
